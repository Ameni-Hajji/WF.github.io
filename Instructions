##Original issues to remember
- File in Google had too many special characters and symbols that did not allow the points to show with qgis2web. I had to paste as values, change format to text, then go through and make all columns single word--not sure which of these caused the issue, but was probably column titles if I had to have a good guess
- Must reproject from WGS Geographic to WGS PROJECTED then add to OSM map.

- In class do hide columns and sort columns

-Once export is made and shown, show how to edit index.html file to:
--update width to full screen
--update start index
--edit pop up content
